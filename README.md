üöÄ Project Overview
This project is a complete business intelligence solution for analyzing supermarket sales data using Power BI. The goal was to transform raw data into a dynamic and actionable dashboard, providing valuable insights into sales performance. The project was designed and executed based on a series of specific tasks, from data cleaning and analysis to designing an interactive dashboard.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
Power BI Desktop: For modeling, analysis, and visual storytelling.

Power Query: For data cleaning and transformation.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating custom measures and key performance indicators.

üìä Key Analyses and Insights
The dashboard was built to meet specific requirements and provide insights into:

Sales Performance: Tracking total sales, quantity, and tax.

Customer Analysis: Identifying total sales and order quantity per customer.

Time Trends: Visualizing total sales by month to identify seasonal patterns.

Shipping Efficiency: Calculating the average number of days to ship to determine operational efficiency.

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Breakdown
<details>
<summary><b>1. Data Cleaning and Preparation (Power Query)</b></summary>
<br>
The raw data was imported into the Power Query Editor, and the following steps were performed to ensure data quality:
<ul>
<li><b>Irrelevant Row Removal:</b> Removed empty or null rows from the bottom of the table.</li>
<li><b>Data Type Conversion:</b> Ensured all columns had the correct data types, such as converting date columns to the "Date" format and numeric columns to "Decimal Number" or "Whole Number".</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>2. Data Modeling and Analysis (DAX)</b></summary>
<br>
The following custom measures and columns were created using DAX to meet the analysis requirements:
<ul>
<li>Total Sales = <code>SUM('Sales'[Total (USD)])</code></li>
<li>Total Quantity = <code>SUM('Sales'[Order Quantity])</code></li>
<li>Average Retail Price = <code>AVERAGE('Sales'[Retail Price (USD)])</code></li>
<li>Average Order Quantity = <code>AVERAGE('Sales'[Order Quantity])</code></li>
<li>Average Tax = <code>AVERAGE('Sales'[Tax (USD)])</code></li>
<li>Days to Ship (<b>New Column</b>) = <code>DATEDIFF('Sales'[Order Date], 'Sales'[Ship Date], DAY)</code></li>
<li>Average Shipment Days = <code>AVERAGE('Sales'[Days to Ship])</code></li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3. Dashboard Design and Visualization</b></summary>
<br>
An interactive dashboard was designed to clearly display the insights, with a focus on specific visualization tasks:
<ul>
<li><b>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):</b> Cards were created to show core metrics like Total Sales, Average Tax, and Average Order Quantity.</li>
<li><b>Analytical Charts:</b>
<ul>
<li>A bar chart showing Total Sales by Customer.</li>
<li>A column chart illustrating Total Sales per Month based on Order Date.</li>
<li>A table displaying Order Quantity per Customer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
